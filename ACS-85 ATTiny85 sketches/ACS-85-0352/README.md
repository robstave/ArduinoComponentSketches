# ACS-85-0352

Sample and Vibrato (ramps)

## Overview

Takes a medium to high audio range clock signal on pin 7 and outputs a squarewave with variable frequency and width.

Vibrato is when you modulate the frequency of the signal (as opposed to tremolo where you modulate the amplitude)

This is not as spectacular as I had hoped, but has promise.

Its basically still a riff on [ACS-85-0350](https://github.com/robstave/ArduinoComponentSketches/tree/master/ACS-85%20ATTiny85%20sketches/ACS-85-0350)

## Strategy

The basic strategy for ACS-85-0353 is the same as [ACS-85-0350](https://github.com/robstave/ArduinoComponentSketches/tree/master/ACS-85%20ATTiny85%20sketches/ACS-85-0350)

## Improvements

This could use some help. It really is not a modulation up and down kinda vibrato, more of
a ramp. A triangle perhaps?
