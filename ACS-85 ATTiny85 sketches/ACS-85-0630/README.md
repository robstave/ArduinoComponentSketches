Sequencer - Turning Style

## Overview

This compact one-knob sequencer brings the classic "turning machine" feel to your setup. The knob adjusts the length of the sequence, and each time you change the size it randomizes the pattern for extra variation. A CV input lets you trigger randomization externally, giving you control over your sequences.
