Lorenz attractor

## Overview

Implentation of the Lorenz Attractor.  Its not mind blowing...but it seems to be giving the right behavior.

I tried to generate this with chatgpt, but it really did not work.
The Math was good though.

This is a rewrite...certainly experiment!

You Will need a low pass filter on the pwm pins.

## Notes

Im Juicing up the Analog write by messing with the timer, but that messes with Delay.  So I creating a delay-like thing from Timer 2
