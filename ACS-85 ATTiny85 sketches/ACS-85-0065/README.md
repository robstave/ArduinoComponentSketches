# ACS-85-0065

Xor Based Phased Drone/VCO


## Overview

Two pins have a drone sound that is pretty phasey sounding.

Based on DDS, there are 6 accumulators.
3 are Xored for PB0 and the other 3 are xored to PB1

The three frequencies will have a "beat" that the XOR highlights.  Does not end up sounding like a ring modulator though.
