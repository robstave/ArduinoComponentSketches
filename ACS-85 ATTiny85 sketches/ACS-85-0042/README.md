Square Wave VCO with Chiptune Sounds

## Overview

This sketch implements a Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO) using a 16-bit counter in a DDS-like fashion. For more details, check out [this article](http://www.technoblogy.com/show?QVN).

The VCO has two outputs:
- A plain square wave.
- A square wave with arpeggios and effects, creating a chiptune-like sound.

There’s plenty of room to experiment with algorithms or create your own effects.

Originally, ACS-85-0040 included this functionality along with other features, but it was a bit too busy. This sketch focuses solely on the chiptune version, reworked for clarity and simplicity.
