Coin Flip Clocked - Output Matches Clock

## Overview

This sketch is inspired by Mutable Instruments' Branches. It triggers on the rising edge of the clock and outputs on either the A or B pin based on probability.

The output gate matches the input clock. It is neither a trigger nor a latch.

A third output pin always operates at a 50/50 probability.

This sketch is similar to [ACS-85-0612](https://github.com/robstave/ArduinoComponentSketches/blob/master/ACS-85%20ATTiny85%20sketches/ACS-85-0612) and [ACS-85-0614](https://github.com/robstave/ArduinoComponentSketches/blob/master/ACS-85%20ATTiny85%20sketches/ACS-85-0614).
