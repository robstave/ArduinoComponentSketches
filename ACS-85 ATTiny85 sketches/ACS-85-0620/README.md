# ACS-85-0620

Trigger to Gate (with a probability output)

## Overview

This sketch converts a trigger into a variable-length gate. You can tweak the values to suit your needs. Note: it's best to use a linear potentiometer for this.

A second pin mirrors the first but with a probability factor. If the probability condition isn't met, the second pin stays low.
