# ACS-85-0617

Probability Drop gate

## Overview

  If the drop pin is low, this is just a 100 passthrough.

  If the pin is high, then the top pin follows the input put with
  a probability of dropping. The other pin is high on the drop.

  This is not too particularly different than  ACS-85-0615
