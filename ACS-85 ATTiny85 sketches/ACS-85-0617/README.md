Probability Drop Gate

## Overview

This sketch acts as a probability-based gate. Here's how it works:

- If the drop pin is low, the input signal passes through 100% of the time.
- If the drop pin is high, the top pin follows the input with a probability of dropping. When a drop occurs, the other pin goes high.

This is conceptually similar to ACS-85-0615 but with a slightly different behavior.
