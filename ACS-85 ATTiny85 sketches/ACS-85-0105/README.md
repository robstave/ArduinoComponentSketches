Cowbell

## Overview

The code as is sums two squarewaves to create a cowbell sound ( roland style)

You can,  if you would like, disable the tuning and just stick with the classic frequencies or add a switch to toggle that.  The code as is allows for tuning.

Its not going to be super.  If you want to replace the lpw with a bandpass you can achieve a closer sound.  Your going to have to google that though
