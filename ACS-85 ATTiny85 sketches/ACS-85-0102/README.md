 ATTiny85 Synth Drum

## Overview

Simple version of EHX space drum.  Ah...really...simple.
   Just a start and end frequency.
   There is a "parameter" value too that will be used for "length",
   but feel free to change that.

## Output

Although it is DDS looking, its just a squarewave and not really PWM.  There is no "decay" or anything like that.
