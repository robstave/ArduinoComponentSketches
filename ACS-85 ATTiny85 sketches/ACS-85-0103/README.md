 ATTiny85 Synth Drum

## Overview

   Simple version of EHX space drum.  Ah...really...simple.
   Start and end frequency is random
   There is a "parameter" value too that will be used for "length",
   but feel free to change that.

   you can sum up for crazier sound
  

## Output

Although it is DDS looking, its just a squarewave and not really PWM.  There is no "decay" or anything like that.
