 ATTiny85 Synth Drum

## Overview

Simple version of EHX space drum.  Ah...really...simple.

Start and end frequency is random
There is a "parameter" value too that will be used for "length", but feel free to change that.

There are three outputs...but the other two are related to the first.

- note
- note with freq modulation
- a fifth above the note

You can sum up the pins with simple resistors for a crazier sound
  
## Output

Although it is DDS looking, its just a squarewave and not really PWM.  There is no "decay" or anything like that.
