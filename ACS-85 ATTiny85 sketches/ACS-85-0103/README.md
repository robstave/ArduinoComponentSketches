# ACS-85-0103

ATTiny85 Synth Drum

## Overview

This is another simple version of the EHX Space Drum. Start and end frequencies are random, adding some unpredictability to the sound.

There’s a "parameter" value used for "length," but feel free to change that.

### Outputs

There are three outputs, but the other two are related to the first:
- **Note**
- **Note with frequency modulation**
- **A fifth above the note**

You can sum up the pins with simple resistors for a crazier sound.

## Output

Although it looks like DDS, it’s just a square wave and not really PWM. There’s no "decay" or anything like that.
