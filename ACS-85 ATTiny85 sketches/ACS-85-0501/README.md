Atari Punk Console.  Improved

## Overview

Attempt to reproduce the Atari Punk Console.

I have not really documented this too much.
This one is a bit better.   I added some filtering so the dials are not glitchy.

There is another pin that is kinda a riff of other values.

There is an issue with a range when one value is larger than another.  Not sure whats up with that yet.

This is a work in progress
