Sinewave VCO PWM with Distortion Options

## Overview

This sketch implements a PWM-based sinewave Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO). It’s not super fast, but it’s workable and fun to experiment with.

It includes:
- A pin for rectification.
- A pin for clipping distortion.

This is a very preliminary implementation, inspired by sketches from [Technoblogy.com](http://www.technoblogy.com/show?22HF). Feel free to tweak and explore!
