ATTiny85 Phase Distortion Chainsaw / Sine - 1v/oct

## Overview

This is a simple implementation of phase distortion. For more details, see:

Note: There are many definitions of phase distortion, but this is not the one described in the CZ-1 Casio patent. What makes that version unique is how the phase change sounds like a filter sweep. It’s not actually a filter, but the math creates that effect.

With minimal effort, you could add a wavetable for a sine wave and easily point each value to it.
