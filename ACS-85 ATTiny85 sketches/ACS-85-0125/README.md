## Overview

Simple version of phase distortion.  See how its described here.

Note again, there seems to be a lot of definitions for this, but it is not
the one in the CZ-1 casio patent.  Part of what makes that one neat is that the 
way the phase change sounds like a filter sweep.  It is not, but it just turns out
that the math works that way.  

With little effort, you could add a wavetable for a sine wave and point each value to
that super easy.
