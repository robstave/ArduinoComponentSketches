Clock Divider

## Overview

    divide the clock by the count of the pot.
    Divide will be a Gate Version with 50% on and 50% off
    Trigger will be the same as divide, but just is a trigger on the rising clock
    
    So say the divide is 3
    Clock  : 1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0
    Trig   : 1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
    Divide : 1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

    reset resets the divisions
