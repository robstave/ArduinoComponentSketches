Drone 3 notes - root fifth and octave with detune

## Overview

Three pins
PB0 is the root
PB1 is and octave lower
PB2 is a fifth above the lower octave

All plain sqaurewaves.

there is also a detune that applies to PB1 and PB2. Feel free to tweak as needed. PB1 detunes down and PB2 detunes up.

You can just sum them together with resistors.
