Nand Synth DX

## Overview

Similar to many other Nand/40106 squarewave noise generators.  This has a single button to toggle through various
configurations.  

The DX is because it reminds me of the DX7 and all the FM configurations you can scroll through with their fun little diagrams on the keyboard.  

There are Three knobs for **Osc1**, **Osc2** and **Osc3**.  **Osc3** is an LFO and is not always used.

The button pin scrolls through all the configurations.

Here is the same sketch driving the 85-0321.  Its a little fuzzier.
