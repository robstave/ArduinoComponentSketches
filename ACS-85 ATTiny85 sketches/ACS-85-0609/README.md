3 Channel drum patterns

## Overview

Just a tempo and scene select for pre-programmed patterns.

Three outputs are set as triggers, but the width of the trigger can be modified in the code.

## Improvements

A Sync would be nice, but there are only so many pins to work with.  Consider driving this with a clk rather than an analog pot/tempo if thats what you need.
