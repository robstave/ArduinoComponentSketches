Square wave VCO with PWM  

## Overview

Uses a 16 bit counter in a DDS fashion like. <http://www.technoblogy.com/show?QVN>

This is a vco with outputs.  One is the main sqaurewave and the other is the same

Originally, I had ACS-85-0040 doing a lot of stuff including this, but it was a bit busy. This does less.
