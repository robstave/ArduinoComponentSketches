3 Channel tone patterns

## Overview

Just a tempo and scene select for pre-programmed patterns.

Three outputs are tones that start with a set freq and detune down.
If you want, add a few more accumulators to make them cowbells

## Improvements

A Sync would be nice, but there are only so many pins to work with.  Consider driving this with a clk rather than an analog pot/tempo if thats what you need.
