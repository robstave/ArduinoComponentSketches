Bytebeat (Bitbeat v2) Clocked

## Overview

Bytebeat refers to a self-generating sequence of bytes using a small equation.

This sketch is based on a snippet I found here:

For a great introduction to Bytebeat, check out this article:  
<http://nightmachines.tv/the-absolute-beginners-guide-to-coding-bytebeats.html>  
It covers the history and references key contributors like Viznut, who helped popularize Bytebeat in the early 2010s.

This sketch is similar in style to ACS-85-0650 but uses a different equation. The key difference here is that the equation is clocked externally, making it somewhat tunable. This approach also reduces the "warble" caused by the main loop's timing driving the speed.
