Bytebeat ( Bitbeat v2) clocked

Not fully tested...close...but should work  See 650 and 651 which are better tested

## Overview

Bytebeat is a term for a self generating sequence of bytes using a small equation.

Based on a snippet I found here

I'm not going to get the story of this right, so instead, I will give you a link.

Here is a great little article that about sums it all up and references all the folks
that were a part of its online explosion like viznut in the early 2010s.
(I Will try and put some info in the wiki)

Based on this snippet <https://pastebin.com/mfnKNWVD>

This is really not too different in style with ACS-0650. I Used another equation and found that you REALLY should listen and pick bits.
The last bit in this case sounded awful.

The main difference here is that the equation is clocked externally.  This make itkinda tunable I guess.  It also reduces the warble as its  NOT the timing of the main loop that is driving the speed.
