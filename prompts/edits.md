# Polishing prompts

## Polishing README.md

So I wrote these a while ago and was kinda quick and dirty. I would like to have a more polished README.md file for each of the sketches. 

I would like to have a more polished README.md file for each of the sketches. I am not looking for a complete rewrite, but rather a light edit to make it less amateurish. My audience consists of "makers" and hobbyists, so we are not going for too technical. I'm talking to folks who are doing this for fun. However, obvious edits are needed.

If a section says "Equivalent" the intent is to explain a close analog to whtat the sketch is doing.
Do not rename that section, but feel free to add a sentence or two if needed.  

keep my light tone, but make it a bit more polished.

## Code Polish

Redo the Comments if needed in the code.  My audience is still makers and hobbyists, so we are not going for too technical. I'm talking to folks who are doing this for fun. However, obvious edits are needed.

in some cases, I have a pinout ascii art.  Keep that, but change it from the // that I have now.

If there are any obvious errors like timer0 vs timer1, please fix them. A lot of the interrupt code is pulled from other sketches, so I may have missed some things.
